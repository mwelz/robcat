Comments mwelz: 
Removed the line `exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")` in NAMESPACE [see here; https://stackoverflow.com/a/46039989]. Otherwise all rcpp functions would be exported, so no helpers are possible. Downside is that devtools will not automatically create the NAMESPACE anymore, meaning thate very function must be manually registered by adding export(funname) in the NAMESPACE (similar for S3 methods).
